Present in HTML format the content of a JSON feed provided by a 3rd party API.
Regardless of how many fields the records may have, we only want to display:

● teaser

● description

● image

Since it’s a 3rd API and we don’t have control over how many rows we can obtain, we want to

make sure that we only present to the users a maximum of 50 rows of data at once with the

option to load more data if they wish.

Notes:

● In order not to rely on an API, we’ll provide you with a sample of the feed that the API

would return

● Good performance and loading times are key

● You can use any JS library or framework that you want. Please give a brief explanation

of the approach that you’ve taken

● We’ll give more value to an unfinished application that is well structured and tested than

a finished one with spaghetti code

● No need to make it look nice, we don’t expect you to be a good designer!

You can find the JSON feed in the following URL:
